# ðŸ—¡ Murder

This is a randomly-generated Cluedo-esque (or "Clue"-esque) murder mystery that I'm working on.

Players find themselves in the midst of a deadly murder and must use their deduction skills to identify the murderer. Only a limited set of questions can be asked so timing and accuracy are key.

Inspirations:
 - [Squidi's "Infinite Detective" game mechanic](http://www.squidi.net/three/entry.php?id=69)
 - The works of Agatha Christie
